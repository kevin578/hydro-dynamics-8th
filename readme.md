The following list shows where each challenge should start at in the box 
using longitude and lattitude based on where the double angled beams are placed, 
labeled 1 for the one in line with the left motor and 2 for the one in line with the right motor:<br>
<br>
**Pipe Removal** - 1: 17 lines lattitude & -0.5 lines longitude (right wheel should be placed just inside the red lego logo)<br>
**Filter** - 1: 12 lines lattitude & -0.5 lines longitude (both wheels on either side of the red lego logo)<br>
**Tripod** - 1: 15 lines lattitude & -0.5 lines longitude (right wheel should be placed just inside the red lego logo)<br>
**Pump Addition** - 2: 0 lines lattitude & 16 lines longitude (both angled beams should touch the southern wall)<br>
**Flow** - 2: 0 lines lattitude & 7 lines longitude (both angled beams should touch the southern wall & both wheels 
      should line up over the red lego logo)<br>
